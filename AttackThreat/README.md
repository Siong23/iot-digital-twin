# IoT Lab Security Testing Framework

A Python-based educational framework for testing IoT device security in isolated lab environments. This tool is designed specifically for cybersecurity education and research in controlled GNS3 lab setups.

## üéØ Purpose

This framework helps security researchers and students understand IoT vulnerabilities by:
- Discovering IoT devices with open Telnet services
- Testing common default credentials
- Documenting vulnerable devices for analysis
- Providing interactive access for security research

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This tool is intended ONLY for use in isolated lab environments that you own and control.** Never use this tool against systems you do not have explicit permission to test. This framework is designed for educational purposes and ethical security research.

## üèóÔ∏è Lab Setup

This framework is designed to work with GNS3 lab environments on Ubuntu containing:
- **IoT Devices**: IP cameras, sensors, smart home devices (simulated using lightweight VMs)
- **Network Infrastructure**: Routers, switches, access points
- **Security Tools**: Kali Linux for additional testing capabilities
- **Isolated Subnets**: Segregated networks for safe testing
- **MQTT Brokers**: Message queuing services for IoT communication

### Ubuntu-Specific Setup Requirements
- **KVM/QEMU**: Hardware virtualization support
- **Bridge Networking**: For GNS3 VM connectivity
- **Docker**: Container support for lightweight services
- **TightVNC**: Remote access to virtual machines

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS (recommended)
- **Python**: Python 3.8 or higher (typically pre-installed)
- **GNS3**: Lab environment setup with virtualization support
- **Network**: Isolated testing environment

### System Requirements
- KVM virtualization support enabled
- Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for multiple VMs)
- 20GB available disk space
- Network access for package installation

### Setup Instructions

1. **Update system packages:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Python development tools (if not present):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev -y
   ```

3. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siong23/iot-digital-twin.git
   cd iot-digital-twin/AttackThreat
   ```

4. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv iot_lab_env
   ```

5. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source iot_lab_env/bin/activate
   ```

6. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install all optional dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Or install selectively for enhanced UI:
   pip install colorama tqdm
   
   # Or run with no dependencies (basic functionality):
   # No installation needed - uses Python standard library only
   ```

7. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python3 exploit.py --help
   ```

## üìã Usage

### Command Line Interface

#### 1. Scan a Subnet (Basic Usage)
```bash
# Scan for devices with open Telnet ports
python3 exploit.py --scan 192.168.1.0/24
python3 exploit.py --scan 10.10.10.0/24
python3 exploit.py --scan 11.10.10.0/24
```

#### 2. Use Custom Credentials File
```bash
python3 exploit.py --scan 192.168.1.0/24 --creds credentials.txt
```

#### 3. List Discovered Vulnerable Devices
```bash
python3 exploit.py --list
```

#### 4. Open Interactive Session
```bash
python3 exploit.py --session 192.168.1.100
```

### Interactive Mode

Run without arguments for menu-driven interface:
```bash
python3 exploit.py
```

Then select:
1. Scan subnet
2. List vulnerable devices
3. Open session

## üìÅ File Structure

```
iot-lab-framework/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exploit.py      # Main framework script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ credentials.txt        # Default credential pairs for testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt       # Optional Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ iot_lab_results.db    # SQLite database (created automatically)
```

## üîß Configuration

### Credentials File Format
The `credentials.txt` file should contain username:password pairs, one per line:
```
admin:admin
root:password
ipcamadmin:admin
temphumidadmin:admin
user:12345
```

### Database Storage
Results are automatically stored in `iot_lab_results.db` (SQLite database) containing:
- IP addresses
- Successful credentials
- Device banners
- Discovery timestamps

## üéì Educational Use Cases

### Lab Scenarios
1. **IoT Device Discovery**: Learn how attackers find vulnerable devices
2. **Credential Analysis**: Study common default passwords in IoT devices
3. **Network Segmentation**: Test isolation between network segments
4. **Incident Response**: Practice detecting and responding to compromises
5. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Document security weaknesses in lab devices

### Learning Objectives
- Understand IoT security fundamentals
- Practice ethical hacking methodologies
- Learn network reconnaissance techniques
- Develop incident response skills
- Study authentication vulnerabilities

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Lab Environment Only
- Use only in isolated, controlled environments
- Never test against production systems
- Ensure proper network isolation
- Document all testing activities

### Rate Limiting
The framework includes built-in rate limiting to prevent overwhelming devices and to simulate realistic attack patterns.

### Data Protection
- All results stored locally in SQLite database
- No data transmitted outside your lab
- Credentials stored in plain text (lab environment only)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection refused" errors:**
   - Verify target devices are running and accessible
   - Check network connectivity in your GNS3 lab
   - Ensure Telnet service is enabled on target devices
   - Verify Ubuntu firewall settings: `sudo ufw status`

2. **"No vulnerable devices found":**
   - Verify credentials file format (Linux line endings)
   - Check if devices use non-standard login prompts
   - Increase timeout values for slow VMs
   - Ensure proper network bridging in GNS3

3. **Database errors:**
   - Check file permissions: `ls -la iot_lab_results.db`
   - Ensure write permissions: `chmod 644 iot_lab_results.db`
   - Verify available disk space: `df -h`
   - Install SQLite3 if missing: `sudo apt install sqlite3`

4. **Python/Virtual Environment Issues:**
   - Ensure Python 3.8+: `python3 --version`
   - Activate virtual environment: `source iot_lab_env/bin/activate`
   - Reinstall packages: `pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

5. **GNS3 Connectivity Issues:**
   - Check bridge configuration: `ip addr show`
   - Verify KVM support: `sudo kvm-ok`
   - Restart GNS3 service: `sudo systemctl restart gns3-server`

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:
```bash
# Add debug output
python3 exploit.py --scan 192.168.1.0/24 --verbose

# Check system logs
sudo journalctl -f

# Monitor network traffic
sudo tcpdump -i any port 23
```

### Performance Optimization
For better performance on Ubuntu systems:
```bash
# Increase file descriptor limits
ulimit -n 4096

# Monitor system resources
htop
iotop
```

## üìö Educational Resources

### Recommended Learning Path
1. **Set up Ubuntu-based GNS3 lab environment:**
   ```bash
   # Install GNS3 on Ubuntu
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gns3/ppa

   sudo apt install gns3-gui gns3-server
   ```

2. **Deploy various IoT device emulations in VMs**
3. **Configure network bridges and isolation**
4. **Run reconnaissance scans using this framework**
5. **Analyze discovered vulnerabilities and document findings**
6. **Practice remediation techniques in the lab environment**
7. **Implement network monitoring and detection rules**

# Add user to required groups
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER

# Enable and start libvirt
sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
sudo systemctl start libvirtd

# Verify KVM acceleration
sudo kvm-ok
```
