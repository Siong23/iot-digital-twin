# IoT Lab Security Testing Framework

A Python-based educational framework for testing IoT device security in isolated lab environments. This tool is designed specifically for cybersecurity education and research in controlled lab setups.

## üéØ Purpose

This framework helps security researchers and students understand IoT vulnerabilities by:
- Discovering IoT devices with open Telnet services
- Testing common default credentials
- Documenting vulnerable devices for analysis
- Providing interactive access for security research
- Demonstrating coordinated attack techniques in a controlled environment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

**This tool is intended ONLY for use in isolated lab environments that you own and control.** Never use this tool against systems you do not have explicit permission to test. This framework is designed for educational purposes and ethical security research.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Python**: Python 3.8 or higher
- **Network**: Isolated testing environment

### System Requirements
- Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended for multiple devices)
- 20GB available disk space
- Network access for package installation

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Siong23/iot-digital-twin.git
   cd iot-digital-twin/AttackThreat
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```powershell
   python exploit_interactive.py --help
   ```

## üìã Usage

### Enhanced Interactive Mode

The interactive version (`exploit_interactive.py`) provides a user-friendly menu-driven interface with improved error handling and user experience:

```powershell
python exploit_interactive.py
```

**Available Operations:**
1. **Scan subnet for vulnerable devices** - Discover IoT devices with open Telnet ports
2. **List discovered vulnerable devices** - View all identified vulnerable devices
3. **Show discovered credentials** - Display recovered credentials in a clean format
4. **Connect to vulnerable device** - Access a specific device with interactive commands
5. **Run coordinated reconnaissance** - Execute parallel recon across all compromised devices
6. **Launch distributed DDoS attack** - Coordinate attacks from all compromised devices
7. **Change scan speed** - Adjust scanning parameters for different environments
8. **Exit** - Quit the application

### Key Features

#### Improved User Experience
- **Continuous menu display** - Menu redisplays after each operation
- **Error handling** - Invalid inputs are gracefully handled without crashing
- **Interactive prompts** - Clear instructions at each step
- **Confirmation before destructive actions** - Safety measures for attack functions
- **Progress indicators** - Visual feedback during long operations

#### Scanning Capabilities
- **Multiple scan speeds** - Choose from slow/stealthy to turbo mode
- **Custom credential files** - Use your own credential list or default
- **Subnet scanning** - Scan entire network ranges for vulnerable devices
- **Automated brute forcing** - Test common credentials against discovered devices

#### Individual Device Interaction
When connecting to a compromised device (Option 4):
- **Command execution** - Run arbitrary commands on the compromised device
- **Interactive shell** - Full shell access with `exit_shell` command to return
- **Automated reconnaissance** - Run predefined recon commands
- **Exploitation commands** - Execute common exploitation techniques
- **Password handling** - Automatic password entry for sudo commands

#### Coordinated Operations
- **Distributed DDoS Attack (Option 6)**:
  - Launch attacks from all compromised devices simultaneously
  - Central command and control interface
  - Automatic password handling across all devices
  - Coordinated attack termination with one keystroke

- **Coordinated Reconnaissance (Option 5)**:
  - Gather intelligence from multiple compromised devices in parallel
  - Collate system information from across the network
  - Map the environment from multiple vantage points

#### Speed Configuration
Four speed modes available (Option 7):
- **Slow** - 10 threads, 2s delay (stealthy)
- **Normal** - 50 threads, 0.5s delay (balanced)
- **Fast** - 100 threads, 0.1s delay (aggressive)
- **Turbo** - 200 threads, no delay (maximum speed - use with caution!)

### Command Line Options

For headless or scripted operation, command-line arguments are supported:

```powershell
# Scan a subnet with default settings
python exploit_interactive.py --scan 192.168.1.0/24

# Use custom credentials file
python exploit_interactive.py --scan 192.168.1.0/24 --creds mycreds.txt

# Use faster scanning speed
python exploit_interactive.py --scan 192.168.1.0/24 --speed fast

# List discovered devices
python exploit_interactive.py --list

# Show only credentials
python exploit_interactive.py --creds-only

# Connect to specific device
python exploit_interactive.py --session 192.168.1.100
```

## üìÅ File Structure

```

## üîß Configuration

### Credentials File Format
The `credentials.txt` file contains username:password pairs, one per line:
```
admin:admin
root:password
ipcamadmin:admin
temphumidadmin:admin
user:12345
```

### Database Storage
Results are automatically stored in `iot_lab_results.db` (SQLite database) containing:
- IP addresses
- Successful credentials
- Device banners
- Discovery timestamps

## üéì Educational Use Cases

### Lab Scenarios
1. **IoT Device Discovery**: Learn how attackers find vulnerable devices
2. **Credential Analysis**: Study common default passwords in IoT devices
3. **Network Segmentation**: Test isolation between network segments
4. **Incident Response**: Practice detecting and responding to compromises
5. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Document security weaknesses in lab devices
6. **Botnet Simulation**: Understand how attackers leverage multiple compromised devices
7. **Distributed Attack Analysis**: Study the impact of coordinated attacks

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Lab Environment Only
- Use only in isolated, controlled environments
- Never test against production systems
- Ensure proper network isolation
- Document all testing activities

### Rate Limiting
The framework includes built-in rate limiting to prevent overwhelming devices and to simulate realistic attack patterns. Adjust the speed settings as appropriate for your lab environment.

### Data Protection
- All results stored locally in SQLite database
- No data transmitted outside your lab
- Credentials stored in plain text (lab environment only)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection refused" errors:**
   - Verify target devices are running and accessible
   - Check network connectivity in your lab
   - Ensure Telnet service is enabled on target devices
   - Check Windows Firewall settings if running in a Windows environment

2. **"No vulnerable devices found":**
   - Verify credentials file format
   - Check if devices use non-standard login prompts
   - Increase timeout values for slow devices
   - Ensure proper network connectivity
   - Try different speed modes

3. **Database errors:**
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure write permissions to the directory
   - Verify available disk space
   - If using Windows, run as Administrator if needed

4. **Input/Output errors:**
   - In the interactive mode, if you encounter display issues, try resizing your terminal
   - For long-running operations, use the appropriate speed mode for your environment
   - If using Windows PowerShell, ensure console encoding is set correctly

5. **Python-related errors:**
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed: `python --version`
   - Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - If using a virtual environment, ensure it's activated

### Rollback Option

If you encounter issues with the main interactive script:
- Use the backup version: `python exploit_interactive_backup.py`
- Report any bugs or issues you find

### Performance Tips

- For large networks, start with a faster scan speed to identify devices quickly
- For more thorough testing, switch to normal or slow mode
- When running coordinated attacks, ensure your lab environment can handle the traffic volume
- For improved reliability in virtual environments, adjust the timeout settings
