## üéØ Overview

This project implements TSM-NIDS (TSMixer Network Intrusion Detection System), leveraging TSMixer neural networks for three main use cases:

1. **Attack Classification**: Multi-class classification to identify specific types of IoT attacks
2. **Attack Identification**: Binary classification to detect whether network traffic is malicious
3. **IoT Digital Twin**: Real-world IoT data analysis using captured dataset

## üìä Datasets

### TON-IoT Dataset (AttackClassification & AttackIdentification)
- **Source**: Publicly available TON-IoT dataset
- **Description**: Comprehensive IoT network traffic dataset with labeled attack types
- **Usage**: Training and evaluation of TSM-NIDS models for security analysis
- **Classes**: Multiple attack types including DoS, DDoS, backdoor, injection, etc.

### Captured IoT Data (IoTDigitalTwin)
- **Source**: Real-world IoT devices in controlled environment
- **Description**: Network traffic captured from actual IoT devices
- **Usage**: Digital twin implementation and real-world validation
- **Format**: Time series data with network flow features

## üèóÔ∏è Model Architecture

The TSM-NIDS system implements a time series neural network based on the mixer architecture described in the [TSMixer paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.06053.pdf). This implementation is adapted from the [pytorch-tsmixer](https://github.com/ditschuk/pytorch-tsmixer) repository for IoT security classification tasks.

### Key Components:
- **Sequence Length**: Variable based on time window
- **Feature Dimension**: Network flow features (packet size, duration, etc.)
- **Hidden Dimensions**: Configurable (default: 64)
- **Number of Blocks**: 15 layers for deep feature learning
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Optional channel and temporal attention
- **Dropout**: 0.1 for regularization

### TSM-NIDS Architecture:
The system leverages mixer layers for processing time series data, offering a robust approach for network intrusion detection tasks. Unlike the original forecasting implementation, TSM-NIDS is specifically adapted for:
- **Multi-class Classification**: Attack type identification
- **Binary Classification**: Attack detection
- **Real-time Processing**: IoT network traffic analysis

## üìÇ AttackClassification

**Purpose**: Multi-class classification of IoT attack types using TON-IoT dataset

### Scalers Tested
- **MinMaxScaler**: Normalizes features to [0,1] range
- **RobustScaler**: Uses median and IQR for outlier-resistant scaling
- **StandardScaler**: Z-score normalization (mean=0, std=1)

### Feature Engineering Approaches
1. **Base (1base)**: Original features without modification
2. **Mutual Information (2mi)**: Features selected based on MI scores
3. **Correlation (3corr)**: Features selected based on correlation analysis
4. **SMOTE (4smote)**: Synthetic minority oversampling technique
5. **PCA (5pca)**: Principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction
6. **Combined (mi_corr_smote_pca)**: Multiple techniques combined

- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

### Experimental Setup

# y_train: (batch_size,) for classification

# Initialize model
model = TSMixer(
    seq_len=X_train.shape[1],
    feat_dim=X_train.shape[2], 
    num_classes=len(unique_labels),
    hidden_dim=64
)

# Training loop (simplified)
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    outputs = model(X_train)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y_train)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
