### üöÄ DDoS ATTACK ANALYSIS RESULTS

#### **Test Scenario:**
- **Total devices compromised:** 5
- **Devices ready for DDoS:** 3 (60% effectiveness)
- **Devices with registration issues:** 2 (40% reduced power)

#### **Issue Identification:**
```
‚ùå 192.168.1.12 (DVR) - 3 registration attempts failed
   Error: C2 server timeout during registration
   
‚ùå 192.168.1.13 (IoT Device) - 2 registration attempts failed  
   Error: Connection refused by C2 server
```
