## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 18.04+ or Windows 10+
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Network Access**: For MQTT broker communication
- **Permissions**: Administrative privileges for network tool installation

### Ubuntu Installation (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iot-digital-twin.git
   cd iot-digital-twin/AttackThreat
   ```

2. **Run the installation script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x installation.sh
   ./installation.sh
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   python main.py --help
   ```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation or the script doesn't work:

1. **Install system dependencies**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y build-essential python3-dev python3-pip python3-venv
   sudo apt install -y nmap netcat-openbsd telnet openssh-client
   sudo apt install -y libffi-dev libssl-dev mosquitto-clients
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### MQTT Broker Setup

The framework requires an MQTT broker for IoT device simulation:

1. **Install local MQTT broker**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
   sudo systemctl start mosquitto
   sudo systemctl enable mosquitto
   ```

2. **Configure broker settings** in `Agent/config/mqtt_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "broker_host": "localhost",
     "broker_port": 1883,
     "username": null,
     "password": null,
     "topics": ["iot/sensors", "iot/commands"]
   }
   ```

### Attack Framework Configuration

Review and modify settings in `AttackThreat/config/` directory:

- **Network settings**: Target ranges and excluded IPs
- **Attack parameters**: Timing, intensity, and methods
- **Logging configuration**: Output formats and destinations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Network Reconnaissance

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Run basic network scan
python main.py --scan --target 192.168.1.0/24

# MQTT vulnerability assessment
python main.py --mqtt --broker localhost --port 1883
```

### IoT Device Simulation

```bash
# Start MQTT agents
cd Agent/
python mqtt_agent.py --config config/default.json

# Deploy attack bots
cd ../AttackBots/
python bot_deployment.py --count 5 --target-network 192.168.1.0/24
```

## Security Considerations

### Ethical Guidelines

1. **Authorization Required**: Never test systems without explicit permission
2. **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities through proper channels
3. **Educational Focus**: Use for learning and improving security posture
4. **Legal Compliance**: Understand and follow all applicable laws

### Safety Measures

1. **Isolated Environment**: Use dedicated test networks when possible
2. **Limited Scope**: Restrict testing to authorized systems only
3. **Monitoring**: Log all activities for audit purposes
4. **Cleanup**: Remove any test artifacts after completion

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the security research community:

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature-name`
3. **Follow coding standards**: Use consistent formatting and documentation
4. **Test thoroughly**: Ensure all changes work in isolated environments
5. **Submit pull request**: Include detailed description of changes

### Contribution Guidelines

- All contributions must maintain the educational focus
- No malicious code or exploits
- Proper documentation required for new features
- Security-focused code reviews mandatory

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure proper user permissions for network tools
2. **Package Conflicts**: Use virtual environments to isolate dependencies
3. **Network Access**: Verify MQTT broker connectivity and firewall settings
4. **Python Version**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed and active

### Getting Help

- **Check logs**: Review application logs for error details
- **Verify configuration**: Ensure all config files are properly formatted
- **Test connectivity**: Verify network access to target systems
- **Update dependencies**: Keep all packages up to date
